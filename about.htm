<h3><font face="Arial">Love was in the Air</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#8D8D8D">Josh and Ashley met at Henderson State
University their freshman year. Ashley had just moved away from home and was
very excited about her newfound freedom. Josh commuted from Bismarck everyday to
save money. They met their first semester in English class, but did not start
dating until the following semester. They got to know each other first and went
on their first date February 3, 2000. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#8D8D8D">They had so much fun together and realized
that they definitely wanted to always be together. Josh first told Ashley that
he loved her on April 2, 2000. From then on, Ashley and Josh knew that they
wanted to get married someday, but they wanted to be out of college first. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#8D8D8D">Well, a few months went by, and Christmas
was fast approaching.&nbsp; Josh knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his
life with Ashley, so he splurged and got her a promise ring, and a promise that
one day they would be married. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" color="#8D8D8D">Many Christmas's, Valentine's Days, and
Anniversaries happened, and the couple were still just as much in love as the
first day that they knew the other was their soul-mate. </font></p>

<h3><font face="Arial" color="#000000">The Engagement</font></h3>
<p><font color="#8D8D8D" face="Arial">Josh and Ashley decided that they would
take a trip to Eureka Springs. After two years and nine months of dating, the
couple had never been on a fun trip together. So they started planning. This
sounded like a great way to get away from all of the pressures of school. Ashley
had a feeling that Josh might ask her to marry him on this weekend. He had been
hinting around about how he would ask her, but he assured her that he did not
have enough money to purchase a ring. But all of Ashley's friends had this
feeling that she would get engaged that weekend. But Ashley put it out of her
head and did not believe them. </font></p>
<p><font color="#8D8D8D" face="Arial">So Josh and Ashley set out for Eureka
Springs. It rained all weekend and was very chilly. The couple didn't do much
sight-seeing Friday night,&nbsp; but Saturday they set out on the town. Even
though Ashley put the engagement idea out of her mind, she was still a little
suspicious. So she decided to look in Josh's overnight bag. She felt around the
clothes, being very careful not to disturb them. She did not find the ring, and
she was very disappointed. She didn't tell Josh about looking in his bag, and
they went on about their day. They went shopping, saw the Passion Play, ate at
Cafe Luigi, and went on a horse and buggy ride. </font></p>
<p><font color="#8D8D8D" face="Arial">\The ride was at the historic Crescent
Hotel. So the couple went behind the hotel to a garden, and Josh pointed out a
bench he wanted to sit on. Josh started talking about their first date and
reminiscing. But Ashley was kind of oblivious to why he was saying all of this.
Josh then stood up and started stretching with his hands in his jean pockets.
Ashley inquired about what he was doing. He replied, &quot;I'm stretching.&quot;
Ashley wondered why Josh was stretching so long. Then Josh stopped stretching,
got down on one knee and said &quot;Ashley, will you marry me?&quot; Ashley was
speechless and very excited. She jumped up and down and much to her surprise,
she had not answered him. She finally got out a yes, and the couple has been
living in engagement bliss since then.</font></p>
