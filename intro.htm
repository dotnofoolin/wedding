<p align="left"><font color="#D2A1F7">12/20/02</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that our
finals and the semester are over, we'll start updating the site more regularly.
As of this update, I've created some more graphics for the other pages and added
some more content to them. Keep an eye on the &quot;<a href="about.htm">About Us</a>&quot; page for a
really cool slideshow of some pictures we've taken over the years. Expect to see
the same type of slideshow in &quot;<a href="wedding.htm">The Wedding</a>&quot; as well. I've also added a
hit counter since the last update, so we all know how many visits our site is
getting. That's all for now, and keep checking up on the site from time to time.</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#D2A1F7">12/4/02 </font><font face="Arial" color="#8D8D8D">&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, as you can see, we've got a web page up and running. There's not much to
look at now, but soon there will be a lots of pictures, directions to the
wedding, shower dates, links to our registries, and tons of other stuff, so
check back often and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us using
one of the ways listed under &quot;<a href="contact.htm">Contact Us</a>.&quot; </font></p>
